If anything, they will go out of their way to show they are worth more. Their scientific institutions on the eastern continent have developed a myriad of technological advancements-bionics and prosthetics used to enhance their own capabilities. There are even vague records that long ago, the Quatryl's scientific research led them to the north to hunt for its secrets, but these facilities have long since fallen to ruin.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that the cold is not a forgiving climate for one so small. If a Blinkblade were to travel north, it may be because they have nowhere else to go, or because there is some quarry to be found. Blinkblades are assassins, after all. Equipped with experimental temporal drives, they can alter the flow of time, moving faster than the eye can see and striking harder than a creature ten times their size. Such actions can only be performed in short bursts however, and there is always a cost to such great power.</p>"

There was once a great war in that region between the Valraths and the humans, both equally interested in conquering the Stormbrew Plains for themselves. The two nations have since made peace, and the Valrath government in particular has made concerted efforts to forsake its aggressive past. In more recent times, they have focused on economic strength over the physical.</p><p>There is a saying among the Valrath: \"In order to survive the ice, one must have an icy soul.\" This is apt for a Deathwalker, a nomad bent on atoning for the Valrath nation's past sins by ensuring the souls of the dead find rest. Wherever great tragedy falls, a Deathwalker is usually not far behind, and Frosthaven has seen plenty of tragedy.</p>"
