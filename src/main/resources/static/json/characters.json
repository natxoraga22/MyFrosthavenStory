If anything, they will go out of their way to show they are worth more. Their scientific institutions on the eastern continent have developed a myriad of technological advancements-bionics and prosthetics used to enhance their own capabilities. There are even vague records that long ago, the Quatryl's scientific research led them to the north to hunt for its secrets, but these facilities have long since fallen to ruin.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that the cold is not a forgiving climate for one so small. If a Blinkblade were to travel north, it may be because they have nowhere else to go, or because there is some quarry to be found. Blinkblades are assassins, after all. Equipped with experimental temporal drives, they can alter the flow of time, moving faster than the eye can see and striking harder than a creature ten times their size. Such actions can only be performed in short bursts however, and there is always a cost to such great power.</p>",

These Sin- Ra are insidious jerks, and if you don’t nip their machinations in the bud, well...” The Blinkblade shrugs their shoulders. “There goes your whole city.”</p><p>They slowly finish packing up their belongings and then move to leave.</p><p>“I can’t say I’ll miss this cold, but, well, I may just miss you lot.” The Blinkblade lingers at the door for a second. “Just a bit, though.” And then—ZIP—they’re gone.</p>",

		"background": "<p>No group is quite so ill-suited for the icy northern climates as the Valrath, who make their homes far to the south around the Red Desert. There was once a great war in that region between the Valraths and the humans, both equally interested in conquering the Stormbrew Plains for themselves. The two nations have since made peace, and the Valrath government in particular has made concerted efforts to forsake its aggressive past. In more recent times, they have focused on economic strength over the physical.</p><p>There is a saying among the Valrath: \"In order to survive the ice, one must have an icy soul.\" This is apt for a Deathwalker, a nomad bent on atoning for the Valrath nation's past sins by ensuring the souls of the dead find rest. Wherever great tragedy falls, a Deathwalker is usually not far behind, and Frosthaven has seen plenty of tragedy.</p>",

The Lurkers search endlessly for the pieces of this crown, haunted by an overwhelming sense of loss. They are driven to reassemble the crown, even if they no longer understand why. The currents have brought these shards to the north, and, close to their source of power, the Lurkers have begun to grow in strength once again.</p><p>Like the ebb and flow of the Lurkers' power throughout history, so too do the tides shift. There is a cycle to all things, and this is particularly exemplified in the Crashing Tides, guardians and protectors of their society and the natural order of things. They build their power over time, and then use it to crash against their foes in a wave of destruction. The waves must recede, of course, but then power will grow once again.</p>",
