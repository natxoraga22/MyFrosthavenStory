An overnight storm has covered the town in a blanket of snow that rises halfway up most of the doors in town. You grumble at first as you dig to clear the longhouse door and get on with your day, but the snow muffles every sound in a way you find soothing, and it isn't long before you and the other inhabitants are free. You breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>And then the attack bells sound.</p><p>An Algox warband approaches the town at speed, using their natural abilities to bound across the deep snow without slowing. The guards on duty scramble to assume battle positions, but when you glance toward the barracks your spirits sink; the gates are still half-buried. You see the massive doors bulge as the guards within push desperately, trying to swing them open against the piled snow. They're making progress, but you can tell they won't make it to the gate towers in time.</p>",

I am putting on a play, tentatively titled The Depths of Anguish, reenacting the most noble of sacrifices on our shores at the hands of the Lurkers. It will be my magnum opus.\" It pauses, dramatically.</p><p>You try to explain that while your services are for hire, those services don't include play-acting. It's more the \"smashing\" type of services, really.</p><p>\"What? No, neverâ€”\" It looks a bit stunned that you'd even consider yourselves actors. \"No, I need you to stand guard in the ocean.
