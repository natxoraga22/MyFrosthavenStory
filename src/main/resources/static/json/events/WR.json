Hundreds, packed in together for warmth or comfort, block the path ahead of you. As you approach, they stop their grazing in an eerie unison, their heads turning in perfect concert. They refuse to part to allow you passage.</p><p>A Quatryl shephard in muddy overalls steps forward from the crowd. \"Yep. They'll let you through, but they want something in return.\" The Kivak blink in unison. You look at him, not understanding. \"It's a Kivak hive. All linked up,\" he says, as if this clarified things.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \"Harrowers... they's a bunch a bugs that all work as one thing. Savvas is thinking rocks. Heck, even humans're just gray worms swimming around in a skull driving a skeleton around. This here's a buncha Kivak all as one. Anyways, they want something first.\" The animals part, leaving a single member of their group staring at you in the center of the clearing.</p><p>\"That one wronged the others. They want you to kill her.\" He shrugs. \"I understand 'em, but I can't say I understand 'em.\" The Kivak waits, unblinkingly.</p>",
