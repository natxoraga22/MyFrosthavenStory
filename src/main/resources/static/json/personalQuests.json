		"description": "Plants are infinitely more interesting than people. There are so many varieties, and each one has unique properties. If you could do nothing but look at new plants all day, you absolutely would. But you’re running out of new plants to look at. Luckily there’s an entirely new ecosystem in the northern part of the continent.",

		"description": "There are many high and lofty goals in life—sick grandmas and epic love. Ridiculous. Only one thing matters and that’s money—getting the most of it and keeping it safe. The weight of gold in your purse is a greater feeling than anything else imaginable, grandmas be damned.",
