That terrible creatures lurked in the mountains, waiting to fall upon unsuspecting travelers in a bloody frenzy. You wouldn’t have expected, however, that the most mundane of threats may end up being the most dangerous.</p><p>Wolves.</p><p>The howling started last night – signals to the pack that prey was near. And now they have gathered, stalking you as you move through the mountains, looking for weaknesses.</p><p>This is no time to be passive. You know it’s only a matter of time before they strike, going after the slowest, oldest members of your caravan. If you want everyone to survive, you’ll need to show these animals that you are not to be messed with. That you are not prey.</p>",

You still need to get over the next ridge before nightfall, and all you’ve done is tire yourself out.</p><p>The caravan trudges forward. Some of its members nod solemnly to you as they pass—a thanks for keeping them alive just a little longer. This brutal place has not won today, but there is always tomorrow.</p>",
