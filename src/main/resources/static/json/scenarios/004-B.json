	"introduction": "<p>The battle is near. Sounds of it echo off the tunnel’s icy walls: metal crashing against stone, thunder ripping the air, the chestshaking howls of Algox. Your breath is heavy as you follow your guide. Closer. Closer. And then you arrive.</p><p>But the middle of battle is no time to stand around. The Algox around you are locked in bitter combat, spells shooting out with terrible quickness and heavy fists swinging. Immediately before you stands a final cluster of guards. Their faces twist in fury at the sight of your party, realizing from which direction you’ve just come.</p><p>“Doomed whelps,” they shout, “we will destroy you for this intrusion!”</p>"
