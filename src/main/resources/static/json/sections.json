The populace barely acknowledge it, but for you it means you’ve linked your fate with that of this town.</p>",

Or, rather…” Pinter unrolls a scroll of parchment on your table, pushing aside your drink. The parchment shows a diagram of some sort of armored ball. “Through it! In a bathysphere!”</p><p>The tinkerer goes on to explain that with this “bathysphere” you could safely descend deep into the Biting Sea for short periods of time. But that only solves the problem of the pressure; you still need to avoid freezing. “I have a plan for that too!” Pinter exclaims, his bleary eye twitching. “All I need is a very, very powerful heat source.” As luck would have it, Pinter believes you might be able to find such a thing somewhere in the middle of the Radiant Forest.</p><p>“The whole forest is unfrozen, even in the winter, so something must be heating it!” Pinter says. “I can’t be certain what it will look like, but I’m certain it’s there, yes. Ah, and with your particular skills, finding it should be no problem.”",

A glass-and-metal orb lies on a pallet in front of you, equipped with two crude propellers and a pair of clockwork arms. Inside it sit a number of rubber suits with glass fishbowl helmets. These suits are connected to the complicated machinery of the orb through tubes in their head and are meant to be deployed from the main bathysphere, “when more maneuverability is required,” Droman explains.</p><p>You’re not sure what to make of it all, but Pinter’s enthusiasm more than makes up for your reaction. He runs you through the machine’s functions, explaining how to adjust the internal environment, how to draw in air through a small outboard port and store it inside. All in all, it looks sturdy, but that does little to calm your nerves.</p><p>You pay the Tinkerer the rest of his fee, and shortly after, the bathysphere is mounted onto the ship.

Yes, perfect, perfect, you must be the ones Satha mentioned. Pinter Droman, tinkerer extraordinaire, at your service.” He bows with a flourish.</p><p>Satha clears her throat, cutting Pinter’s introduction short. “A recent landslide changed the landscape of the Frozen Pass,” the mayor explains, “Between the rocks that fell out of the way and the valleys they filled up, we think we can create a shortcut through the Coppernecks that could save days for supply teams and merchants coming across the mountains.”</p><p>You recall your own recent journey over the pass, and agree you’d have appreciated a shortcut.</p><p>“That’s the spirit!” Satha continues, “A shortcut means more merchants bringing goods, and more goods means more outposters survive the winter. Pinter here is in charge of the engineering.”</p><p>“Yes!” Pinter jumps back in, unable to contain his excitement. “The place we’re looking to build,” he points to a map on the table, “is a landslide area that’s almost clear of rocks. I’ve created explosive devices to help remove the rest, but the fauna of the area are quite aggressive, and I can’t get a team close enough to plant the charges.”</p><p>“That’s where you come in,” Satha explains. “I told Pinter you’re the only ones I trust to get those bombs where they need to be and handle yourself against the local animals. We’ll have the charges packed and ready to go at dawn.”</p><p>You nod and turn to go prepare your own supplies, but Pinter interjects. “And not to worry, the charges are completely safe!” he says, unprompted. “I’ve learned so much since my, er, unfortunate incident in Gloomhaven.” Somehow his assurance does not increase your confidence.</p>",
