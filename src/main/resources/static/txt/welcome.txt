<p>With your head down, you march. One foot, then the other. You try to block out the pain: the throbbing in your toes, the numbness in your face. Just keep the rhythm, you think—one, two—but the wind isn’t so easily ignored. It claws at you, whipping up ice and snow like tiny hooks, making every breath difficult. Your skin is thick, you always prided yourself on that, but nothing is thick enough for this. You are walking through the Frozen Wastes, a place far to the north where only the hard and the lost dare to travel. Of course, that’s probably why they hired you.</p><p>It’s been ten days of plowing through snow drifts as high as your waist, and there’s still no sign of the town. You’re mercenaries hired as part of a support team, the first group of the season sent to check on humankind’s most distant outpost—Frosthaven. It’s a place forgotten by most of the world: a tiny settlement carved out of the frozen wilderness that, for half the year, is wholly cut off from the empire, isolated by towering, unbreachable drifts. But as of last week, just enough snow has melted off the Imperial Pass for a team to get through. They were hiring, and your coin purses were empty. So then, here you are.</p><p>No one really knows what awaits you in Frosthaven. Your snow-muddled mind struggles to imagine what sort of people could survive through the winter in a place like this. But whoever’s there, you hope at the very least they’ve left a fire going.</p>
